## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-07-02</sub>

- *(minor)*
  Add the squeeze-paragraphs plugin set: removes empty (whitespace-only) paragraphs — those with no children or only whitespace text. CommonMark never emits an empty paragraph on its own, so this is a cleanup pass for residue left by other transforms (e.g. a comment stripper, or a plugin that lifts an element out of its wrapping paragraph); place it last in the pipeline to tidy that residue. The markdown-it and remark plugins emit identical HTML. Also bundles the `markdown-squeeze-paragraphs` VSCode preview extension in the extension pack.
